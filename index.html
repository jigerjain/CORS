    <h1>    How you doing people!!</h1>
    We would be refreshing our understanding on CORS using this Application!

    <h2>Demo 1: Fetching cross.site resources</h2>
    First we would try to fetch an api(api/post) of cross.site:8000 from the amazing.world:9000 website and see check our console for details
    Did you see any error??

    <h2>Demo 2: Allow amazing.world to access the api</h2>
    Adding Access-Control-Allow-Headers on the server to see the changes<br>
    There are 3 approaches now, we would look into few vulnerabilities of each methods if not set properly<br><br>
    <li>Allow all: *</li>
    <li>Regular expression allowing</li>
    <li>Whitelisting</li>

    <h2>Demo 3: Preflight requests</h2>
    This time we would try to access the api by not using simple request which would indeed call for preflight request

    <h2>Demo 4: Sending credentials and cookies</h2>
    This time we would try to send some cookies and check how the server replies with new settings

    <h2>Demo 5: Exposing Headers </h2>
    This time we would try check if browser has something which it wants to expose or not
